## *Network modelling for high-dimensional data*-course
This repository contains the introductory slides and the materials, slides and practical, for the course part related to time-course experiments. The practical requires the installation of several R-packages. In particular the ```ragt2ridges``` package, which implements most of the discussed methodology.

Materials:

  * ```WNvanWieringen_NetworkModelling4HDdata_Intro.pdf```: Slides of introduction to network modelling.
  * ```WNvanWieringen_NetworkModelling4HDdata_TimeCourses.pdf```: Slides with exercises to network modelling for time-course omics data.
  * ```VARpractical.html``` : R-code, solutions and exercises with additional explanations.
  * ```VARpractical.pdf```: R-code, solutions and exercises with additional explanations (pdf-version of the former).
  * ```VARpractical_codeOnly.R```: Bare R-code from the previous two files.

This repository, all materials, can be downloaded by pressing the green 'Clone or download' button and choosing 'Download ZIP'.
